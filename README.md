# Ono Sweets

##### **Ono Sweets** is a fullstack web application designed for helping the user find desserts in any of the islands of Hawaii.  Although it focuses on Hawaii, the user has the capability to use the application from almost anywhere.  Integration of the Yelp API allows users to search for dessert venues by zip-code or city, then uses Google Maps API to dynamically display the directions from the user's location to the venue.  The app allows the user to save their favorite venues in their profile so they can reference them at a later time.

¡Vámonos!

Learn more about the developer: www.linkedin.com/in/carolynjoneslee/

¡Vámonos! is a fullstack web application designed for planning an itinerary of events for groups of people travelling together. Integration of the Eventbrite API allows users to browse events happening across the globe, or find activities happening at their destination, during their travel dates. Users can add their friends, and automatically keep track of who wants to attend each event. ¡Vámonos! uses Google Maps to dynamically display the location of each event, and the Twilio SMS API to send out text message reminders before the trip begins! Lastly, the app automatically generates a PDF version of the itinerary, containing information for each day about the events planned, and who is attending each event.

Version 2.0

Custom Notifications

I'd like to allow users to customize notification options, such that individualized text messages are sent out before certain events begin, or when trip details change, etc.

Google Calendar

In a future version, I'd want to integrate the Google Calendars API such that users could export the events from their itinerary directly to a Google Calendar, or import events from a Google Calendar onto their itinerary.

Facebook Friends

I would like to incorporate the Facebook API, allowing users to login/signup through Facebook, and include their Facebook friends in their travel plans.
